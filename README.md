# Data Literacy Project 2022/2023

## Impact of most Common Food Categories on Green House Gas Emissions

### Goal of the project :chart_with_upwards_trend:
The goal of the project is to analyze the emissions of common plant based food and animal derivated food, 
in order to establish if there are significant evidence that one of the two categories emits less pollution than the other.

### Data used :link:
All the used data is taken from [Environment Impact of Food Production](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/selfvivek/environment-impact-of-food-production).
This dataset has been also augmented manually by us with a column indicating if a food is plant based or not.

### Relevant paths :book:
- **analysis/data_exploration.ipynb**: notebook containing data exploration and hypothesis testing
- **analysis/example_diets.ipynb**: notebook containing a comparison between two hand crafted daily diets
- **data/**: folder containing the dataset
- **doc/**: folder containing all the latex material, as well as the final report
